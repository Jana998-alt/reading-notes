# Read 05 - Operators and Loops
## comparison operators 
Sometimes, the action that we want to do is based on some comparision between the inputs. for that, comparison operators are used, they yeild a boolean type. 
they are: 
| operator | function |
| ----- | ----- |
| == | are the two variables equal to each other? |
| != | are they NOT equal? |
| === | Strict equality |
| !== | Strict inequality |
 | >= |  larger than or equal to | 
## Loops 
Here are the 3 common types of loops:
1. **for** Statment. 

syntax
```
for (counter , condition , update of the counter){
    things to run if the condition is true
} 
```
2. **while** Statment

while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known. 

Syntax
```
while(condition) {
    things to run if the condition is true
}
```
