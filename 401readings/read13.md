# Linear Regressions 


## Introduction to Simple Linear Regression
_From [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsVBBJRb9TE)_

linear regression is the modeling of 2 variables as a linear relationship. this acts as a good estimate for some problems, it is ment to predict the relationship between 2 variables, so it becomes possible predict the value of one of them based on the other. 

## How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn

the least squares method is a very populer method to estimate the coefficients of linear regression. 

first, import linear regression from sci-kit learn module.

mportant functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:

- lm.fit() -> fits a linear model

- lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients

- lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
