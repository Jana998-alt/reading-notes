## Data Science Primer

Machine learning is not about algorithms 

Rather ...

Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems

Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.
For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.

Terminology:
- Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
- Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
- Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
- Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
- Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
- Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
- Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

**A task** is a specific objective for your algorithms.
Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.
In fact, you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won't know which one will perform best for your dataset.
