## White board advice

The most important advice is to: communicate! that should be done during the whole interview. 

first, restate the question after they ask you. ask about edge cases, and also test cases. 

write your pseudo code, and ask: does it make sense?
stepping through the logic of the solution in the pseudocode is very important, and even if you could not write the actual code correctly, the pseudo code would save you. 

## 6 tips

- take a minute or two to think about the problem in the silence, it is ok to be silent. 
- take a minute to think about edge cases before declaring your solution. 


the interviewers are looking for the answers of these questions:
- Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
- Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
- How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
- Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
- Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
- Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
