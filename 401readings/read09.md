## Dunder Methods

this is a name for methods that start and end with a double underscore, '_ _ str _ _'. these methods have the quality of being emulatable by other classes, classes that you make. 

this can be done by definig these methods in your class, that way it allows for using other built in functions and methods. 

for example: defining _ _ str _ _ enables you to print an object. 

defining _ _ len _ _ enables you to get the len(object)

defining _ _ getitem _ _ makes the object iterable

defining _ _ eq _ _ and _ _ lt _ _ allows comparasion between objects. 

_ _ add _ _ for adding objects

and many more. 

## Statistics - Probability

![normal distribution](3vDS2Au.png "normal")

when we speak about statistics, normal distribution is the most important thing to mention. it describes a lot of (if not most) behaviours in nature. 

The most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape. In a probability context, the high point in a normal distribution represents the event with the highest probability of occurring. As you get farther away from this event on either side, the probability drops rapidly, forming that familiar bell-shape. The high point in a statistical context actually represents the mean. As in probability, as you get farther from the mean, you rapidly drop off in frequency. That is to say, extremely high and low deviations from the mean are present but exceedingly rare.

Three Sigma Rule
The Three Sigma rule, also known as the empirical rule or 68-95-99.7 rule, is an expression of how many of our observations fall within a certain distance of the mean. Remember that the standard deviation (a.k.a. “sigma”) is the average distance an observation in the data set is from the mean. The Three Sigma rule dictates that given a normal distribution, 68% of your observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% will fall within two, and 99.7% will fall within three.

Z-score
The Z-score is a simple calculation that answers the question, “Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean?” The equation below is the Z-score equation.
