## Pain and Suffering 

We are being so mentally prepared for this course LOL! 
it is really useful, because mental strength is what determines the success. 
the bottom line of this article: growth is painful, but you should always remember what you are doing this for.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

**Big O!** is a notation that is used to describe the complexity/execution time/memory needed for an operation to take place. this has general rules: O(1) —→ does not change with data size, O(N) —> changes linearly with the data size input, O(Log N) —> this is my favorite! the execution time increases by only Log N when the data increases. so if a set of 10 items of data takes one sec, a set of 100 takes 2 secs!, etc ... 

we study about Big O so we can make the best choices while writing algorithms.


## Facts and Myths about Python names and values:

python NEVER copies values. it only assign the new variable to the same value. hence when you make the change on the value through one variable, it changes for the other as well.

utilizing the immutable values helps over coming this problem. when you make a change on an immutable value, what you are actually doing is that you are creating a new value and assigning it to the variable.

variables are references to values in the memory. 

in for loops, when you reach the return value, the local variables and their values are removed from the memory. you should make sure that you have changed the variables outside of the local scope.
