## Read 06 - Design web pages with CSS

CSS is responsible of outline and design of the webpages. it is embeded through HTML code, and treats every HTML element as if it was within its own box.
General display: 
``` 
selector{ property1: value1; property2: value2}
```
the selector could be for general elements, like : _body_ 
and it could be for a specific word: _p_ 
in CSS, it is better to use an external sheet for the code, this way it can be used as a template, and it is clearer this way as well.
