# Read04: React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’? a component in which its values are controled by React.


Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

we should update when the user submits the form, it is less work and makes sense.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

```event.target.value```


## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator?

it is simply a shorter code.


Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

``` 
 if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
```

```
x===y ? true : false;
```

## Things I want to know more about

- **method.bind** I came across it, and do not exactly know what it does.
- **partialState** meaning.
