## I am Jana Abdelkader. I am a person who loves learning, trynig new things and life!
I am a fresh physics graduate, and although I adore physics, I just can not stick to one thing for my entire life.  Therefore, I am very excited to be learning software development, learn new ways of thinking, researching more about it and becoming a better mind and a better person.
