## I am Jana Abdelkader. I am a person who loves learning, trynig new things and life!
I am a fresh physics graduate, and although I adore physics, I just can not stick to one thing for my entire life.  Therefore, I am very excited to be learning software development, learn new ways of thinking, researching more about it and becoming a better mind and a better person.

## We have been asignd to read about the concept of **growth mindset**, and to write a summery about it, my summery is below.

In physics, a famous principle:
> _"least action principle"_    
> formulated by Pierre Louis Maupertuis

This principle simply claims that physicsl bodies take the easiest way they can. I believe this principle actually applies to our lives, we tend to do what is easiest for us, this is the exact opposite for **growth mindset**. 
to build our growth mindset to be stronger, we must resist the _"least action path"_. the best way to do it is to review each day before you sleep, and ask yourself quistions that help you grow. for example: how can I make my day better tommorow? istead of: how bad was my day? the latter is a destructive mindset indeed. 
finally, we all need to have that balance between working hard and being easy on yourself when it really needs that.

### 3 Reminders for me to have better growth mindset:
- Do not give up on your self, you are doing all this work to make her better.
- Be consistent on reviewing your days, this does magic.
- you have your own strengths and weaknesses, you got to work on both to become better.
