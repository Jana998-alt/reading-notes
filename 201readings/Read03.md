### CSS Box Model

CSS deals with HTML elements as each element has its own box. 
To style the pages, we should play around with these boxes, changing their sizes, colors and more. 

_To change the size, there are 3 ways:_
1-	Pixels
2-	Percentages
3-	Ems: size of the box based on the size of text within it. 
You can use: min-width or max-width properties to fit into different screen sizes. 

_Overflow property:_

Can be **hidden** or **scroll**

_Around the box_

There are: Borders, Margins, and padding. Check the image:

Some of Border’s properties: width, style, color, or rounded corners (border-radius: 80px 50px )

_Centering Content:_

Specify the width of the box first, then set left & right margins to be auto. (sometimes you need to set **text-align** to center)

_display property:_

Inline, block, inline block, or none.

_visibility property:_ 

Hidden or visible.
