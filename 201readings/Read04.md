### Layout

Designing pages is something totally different than skills in coding, but it is as essential to fulfil the goal which is to create a professional website. 
How can we do our designs so they look exactly like we expect them to be? Here are some traits that CSS can perform, that help in our work:

1.	Positioning elements: for ex: fixed position, relative positioning or absolute positioning.  
2.	Float vs. clear. These two work kid of opposite ways but they work side by side. Float 
3.	Overlapping elements: z-index.

Also, there are some techniques to use the same traits to do different designs. 
For example, to do a multi column design, use the attributes: float, width, and margin. 

### Screen sizes

	Designs should adapt to different screen sizes. The elements sizes and positioning differ with different screen sizes(pixels or physical size). The screen should look friendly in all possibilities. You can set the size of elements to be fixed in all screen sizes or you can make them liquid. You have to be smart. 

## Functions

Functions are a set of instructions that are preformed when called later(not when they are declared). 

Key words for functions: 
+ return value
+ function identifier
+ parameters ---> When function is called ---> Arguments
+ variable scope: Global& local.

### Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”

I am just IN LOVE with all the articles of this type that we have to read as an assignment. 
They have benefited me very much personally and in the course.
In this article, Allie Grampa’s subject was: pair programming, that is: the collaboration between 2 programmers on one project in a certain manner. In pair programming, one of the team members writes down the code, and the other member talks out loud how to write specific tasks into a code, but without saying the code exactly, along with making sure the code writer is writing correctly. Allie argues in this article that pair programming is way better for several reasons: increase of fun, combining different ways of thinking, saving time while trying to figure things out, and more. She says that the key for this is “communication”.
