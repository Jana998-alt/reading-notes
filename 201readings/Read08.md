# Layout/CSS
There are 3 main positioning modes that can be used in CSS: 
1.	Normal positioning -- default mode, where elements are set under each other.
``` position:static ```
``` position:relative ``` -- same position as normal, but moving relative to it, to the right, left, up or down.
2.	Fixed positioning -- the elements don’t move up the screen as the user scrolls down, they have a ‘fixed’ position.
``` position:fixed ```
3.	Absolute positioning  -- these elements have a specific position that doesn’t change. 
``` position:absolute ```


Liquid layout: using percentages to specify the size of the element depending on the size of the screen.
Grid layout: is a way of organizing and styling the pages. Which organizes elements in boxes next to each other.
